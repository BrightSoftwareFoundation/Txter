A free text editor - free to everyone.

## What is Txter?
**It is a free Text Editor!**

**Yes, why Txter? There's a bunch of Text editors (or, code editors) in the world now, include Notepad++, Sublime Text, Atom, ... But we know that we are making the most famous and comfortable text editor! Txter is free. It is freeware. You do not need to pay as like as Sublime Text. It is also UI-beautiful, a very succinct user interface, given your eyes a better viewpoint. Based on PyQt for GUI and sys, os for system, Txter is written in 100% Python. You do not need so much disk space to contain our project, as the CPU and code it use lesser!**
